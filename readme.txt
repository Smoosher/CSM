Version Plan for Java based software to help with the help desk day to day tasks, the idea is that this software will be able to do everything
that we need to on a day to day basis with key points being.

-Remote Desktop
-Customer Database
-Log Into Vbox
-Log Into Server
-Kill Users
-Log Calls
-Assest List

To keep this project, intresting for me we will version control the entier thing starting small and building on the base product rather
than what i normally do which is just throw everything in at the same time.

Here are the general Synopsis and Features on a per version basis.

Version 1
This will be a basic remote desktop tool, linking in with Plink and helping you connect to the sites, this will do nothing but pass varibles
to the Plink and help initiate connection.

-Remote Desktop
